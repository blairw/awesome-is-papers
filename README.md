## Research Methods

- [Miranda et al. (2022) _MISQ_](https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol46/iss2/4/) - Computationally Intensive Theory Construction

## IS Discipline and IS Editorials

- [Hirschheim and Klein (2012) _JAIS_](https://doi.org/10.17705/1jais.00294) (doi: `10.17705/1jais.00294`) - "glorious and not-so-short history" of IS discipline
- [Rai (2017) _MISQ_](https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol41/iss2/2/) - "formulating IS research problems that matter"
  - Notable for the _"affirming that gravity works in my kitchen"_ quote (p. vi)
- [Sarker et al. (2019) _MISQ_](https://doi.org/10.25300/MISQ/2019/13747) (doi: `10.25300/MISQ/2019/13747`) - "sociotechnical axis of cohesion for the IS discipline"
